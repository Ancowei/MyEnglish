1 The roots of the Cold war
Introduction: 
The Cold War is the name given to the relationship that developed primarily between 
the USA and the USSR after World War Two. The Cold War was to dominate international
affairs for decades and many major crises occurred - the Cuban Missile Crisis, Vietnam, 
Hungary and the Berlin Wall being just some.For many the growth in weapons of mass destruction was 
the most worrying issue.
Do note that USSR in 1945 was Russia post-1917 and included all the various countries that now
exist individually (Ukraine, Georgia etc) but after the war they were part of this huge country 
up until the collapse of the Soviet Union (the other name for the USSR).

Logic would dictate that as the USA and the USSR fought as allies during World War Two,
their relationship after the war would be firm and friendly. This never happened and any 
appearance that these two powers were friendly during the war is illusory.

Before the war, America had depicted the Soviet Union as almost the devil-incarnate.
The Soviet Union had depicted America likewise so their ‘friendship’ during the war was 
simply the result of having a mutual enemy - Nazi Germany. 
In fact, one of America’s leading generals, Patton, stated that he felt that the Allied 
army should unite with what was left of the Wehrmacht in 1945, utilise the military genius 
that existed within it (such as the V2’s etc.) and fight the oncoming Soviet Red Army.
Churchill himself was furious that Eisenhower, as supreme head of Allied command, 
had agreed that the Red Army should be allowed to get to Berlin first ahead of the Allied army. 
His anger was shared by Montgomery, Britain’s senior military figure.

So the extreme distrust that existed during the war, was certainly present before the end of the war…….
.and this was between Allies. The Soviet leader, Joseph Stalin, was also distrustful of the Americans 
after Truman only told him of a new terrifying weapon that he was going to use against the Japanese. 
The first Stalin knew of what this weapon could do was when reports on Hiroshima got back to Moscow.

So this was the scene after the war ended in 1945. Both sides distrusted the other.
One had a vast army in the field (the Soviet Union with its Red Army supremely lead by Zhukov)
while the other, the Americans had the most powerful weapon in the world,
the A-bomb and the Soviets had no way on knowing how many America had.

Body:
American fear of communist attack;
Truman's dislike of Stalin;
Russia's fear of the American's atomic bomb;
Russia's actions in the Soviet zone of Germany;
American's refusal to share unclear secrets;
Russia's fear of American attack;
Russia's expansion west into Eastern Europe + broken selection promise;
Russia's need for a secure western border;
Russia's aim of spreading world communism;
All this feeling of suspicion lead to mutual distrust and this did a great deal to deepen the cold war;

The Midterm Essay
The roots of the Cold War
Review of the roots of the Cold War, I think the opposite national interests of USA and the Soviet Union, the lack of mutually understanding an alien culture are the inevitable roots of Cold War. Besides, the British role, the atomic bomb and the personal factor are the accelerant of the Cold War.
The inevitable roots: the opposite national interests of USA and the Soviet Union and the lack of mutually understanding an alien culture.

September 1945, during the London foreign minister meeting, the Truman decided to announce that there was a split world, and declared that the United States decided to one of the camps for jihad. On February 9, 1946, Stalin in Moscow Stalin selection to voters released by the United States supreme judge William Douglas described: "the third world war declaration" the important speech said: "the occurrence of war is the modern monopoly capitalism world based on various kinds of economic and political forces development inevitable product, the first world war and the second world war is the capitalist economic system crisis results.

Two big powers, two to the output his ideology goal,  two at daggers drawn ideology, whether in ideological theory, or in its ideology under the influence of the action, are unable to avoid the essence of confrontation.
The difference of ideology directly led to the two countries and two big faction mutual scandals , severely damaged the war friendly cooperation platform. Most of all,  beauty Sue both countries believe that ideology to the fundamental difference between conflict is inevitable.
The British role
The British war cannot alone against Germany, in the post-war more weakness against the Soviet union, so he tried to fight for ocean the other shore, the American power to common contain the Soviet union.
At the beginning of 1946, already fall from power Winston Churchill, in the United States lobbying, published the famous "iron curtain speech"; In 1947, the British government made a false scent meter, active the original belong to oneself power range of Greece, Turkey to the United States, the United States at this time already determined the contain the Soviet union expansion cold war strategy, hence then in duty bound to receive down and seize the opportunity posing "Truman doctrine", "a declaration of war" to the Soviet union, the cold war broke out formally.

war broke out on to the promoting role. ②
The atomic bomb role
During world war Ⅱ, the United States the sole master powerful bombs and manufacturing technology, are without and equal strategic advantage position
If the United States before to the Soviet union's military strength and the apprehension of words, now the atomic bomb is its' back, in Japan throwing bomb, Truman also is not completely to deal with Japan, it is also against the Soviet union from consideration, sought to prevent the Soviet union expansion in the far east, offset due to the impact of war and the Soviet union, so as to make the United States in the region dominated.
It is due to the exclusive mastery of the atomic bomb, the Soviet Union to take a tough against policy, worsening the USA-soviet relations, accelerated the outbreak of the cold war.
The Soviet Union in 1949 the first atomic bomb explosion, broke the United States nuclear monopoly. Invention and production this terrible weapons is meant to win over each other, the results turned out, be mutual awe, is unable to begin restriction factor.
From this point of view, in the United States monopoly atomic bomb, atomic weapons this shooting war weapon is manufacturing cold war accelerator, prompting the cold war broke out. In the nuclear balance of power appears, also becomes the inhibition of the cold war into shooting war blocking

device, is the cold war was cold but not one of the important reasons for the war. ③
The personal factor
The leaders of the two countries to each other's understanding, and dealing with the question way, also make the form of the cold war become more severe.
The Soviet Union postwar behavior motive is to ensure that the western security, but most American leaders don't think so. First of all exaggerate ideology crisis, think that the Soviet union was an empire, inevitable outward expansion of communism; Secondly exaggerated Russia historical tradition to Soviet influence, think that the Soviet union will implement Russia expansionism policy, the eastern Europe as a springboard, and then to Western Europe expansion, Truman's several to Sue policy is based on the above considerations. And the Soviet union on the west,  especially the United States distrust, think the United States is the biggest threat to the Soviet union after the war. In a word, beauty Sue are analyzed the motivation of the other party, exaggerated the threat to their own.
Leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States to deal with foreign problem style and strategy to a certain extent,  increased tension between both sides. Roosevelt to deal with foreign flexible, make personal diplomacy, both easy to reach a compromise, seek common ground while putting aside differences. Truman to Sue is tough, aggravating the Soviet

Union suspicion, make both parties mutual trust, an eye for an eye, and lead to the conflicts intensified, to fight. ④
The Policy Of “Containment”
Containment was a United States policy using numerous strategies to prevent the spread of communism abroad. A component of the Cold War, this policy was a response to a series of moves by the Soviet Union to enlarge communist influence in Eastern Europe, China, Korea, and Vietnam. It represented a middle-ground position between détente and rollback.
The basis of the doctrine was articulated in a 1946 cable by U.S. diplomat George F. Kennan. As a description of U.S. foreign policy, the word originated in a report Kennan submitted to U.S. Defense Secretary James Forrestal in 1947, a report that was later used in a magazine article. It is a translation of the French cordon sanitaire, used to describe Western policy toward the Soviet Union in the 1920s.
The word containment is associated most strongly with the policies of U.S. President Harry Truman (1945–53), including the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a mutual defense pact. Although President Dwight Eisenhower (1953–61) toyed with the rival doctrine of rollback, he refused to intervene in the Hungarian Uprising of 1956. President Lyndon Johnson (1963–69) cited containment as a justification for his policies in Vietnam. President Richard Nixon (1969–74), working with his top advisor Henry Kissinger, rejected containment in favor of friendly

relations with the Soviet Union and China; this détente, or relaxation of tensions, involved expanded trade and cultural contacts.
President Jimmy Carter(1976-81) emphasized human rights rather than anti-communism, but dropped détente and returned to containment when the Soviet invaded Afghanistan in 1979.president Ronald Reagan(1981-89), denouncing the Soviet state as an “evil empire”, escalated the Cold War and promote rollback in Nicaragua and Afghanistan. Central programs begun under containment, including NATO and unclear deterrence, remained in effect even after the end of the war.⑤
The relation of <on the road > and the policy of containment
遏制政策使得美国的经济高速发展，很快进入了一个大消费的社会，人们陶醉在这繁荣里，普遍认为成功只意味着按照现存秩序在社会中获得一定的地位，任何个性化的生活都被认为是逾矩行为而为人所不屑。与这种安定，富足的日常生活相对照，是人们精神状态的极度紧张。战争已经结束，但是战争的阴影却没有消失，冷战的恐怖气氛使得人人自危，此时，无论在政治上，文化上，还是日常生活上都笼罩着一种压抑个性的气氛。
遏制政策中体现的这种生活上的实惠原则、政治上的冷战心理和文化上的贵族倾向使五十年代初期的美国处于一种麻痹的状态中，它与战后的整个西方世界普遍存在的精神危机尖锐对立。这种表面的暂时的稳定必然随着人们深入的反思而逐渐动摇。到了五十年代后期，“跨掉的一代”率先从实践上冲破了但是的那种麻痹状态。他们把自己成为“垮掉的一代”就是指被当时那种压抑的社会所打垮。
如同其他“跨掉一代”的其他作品一样，《on the road》只是描写了一群处于社会

边缘、不务正业的流浪汉略带疯狂但充满乐趣的生活。这种描述体现了一种新的情感和新的生活态度，那就是对现实的背叛以及对现实自我与表达自我的肯定。
这部作品对于生活的思考和感受，无疑代表了但是年轻一代人共同的精神状态。“on the road” 往往给人一种纵横交错、飘忽不定的感觉，这正如书上所描述的那些经历了现实生活中的战争与精神上的动乱之后的新代人那样，他们抛弃了旧有的社会道德和价值标准，迫切希望用自己的眼光重新认识社会。然而，在庞杂的社会思潮面前，他们又显得茫然无措。
《on the road》同时体现了一种对生活的理解，在这无始无终、变幻莫测的慢慢路途中，你冗员无法知道前面等待你的是什么。在《On the road》书中，我们可以看到“垮掉一代”对今天迷茫和对明天的希望--“明天”—多么诱人的字眼，也许它意味着天堂。⑥
